# Preparing for Influenza Season with Tableau

## Project Overview

This project, created by **Paul Maden**, aims to inform strategic healthcare staffing decisions during the influenza season across the United States. Leveraging CDC and WHO data, as well as U.S. Census statistics, the analysis identifies high-risk areas and recommends timely deployment of medical personnel to mitigate flu-related hospitalizations and deaths.

## Objective

- **Goal:** Determine *when* and *how many* temporary healthcare staff should be allocated across different U.S. states.
- **Focus:** Elderly populations (65+) and vulnerable groups most impacted by seasonal influenza.
- **Scope:** All 50 U.S. states, with statistical modeling and data visualization used to guide decisions.

## Key Findings

- **Strong Correlation:** 
  - A strong positive correlation (r = 0.94â€“0.95) exists between both total population and the 65+ age group with influenza-related deaths.
- **State-Level Insights:**
  - States like **Florida** and **New York** with higher elderly populations are more susceptible to flu-related fatalities.
- **Statistical Significance:**
  - Hypothesis testing confirms the relationship between vulnerable populations and increased influenza deaths (p < 0.05).

---

## Limitations

- **Geographical Specificity:** State-level data lacks city-level granularity.
- **Temporal Resolution:** Data covers 2009â€“2017 and lacks real-time updates or weekly granularity.
- **Reporting Discrepancies:** Variations in how influenza deaths are recorded across states can introduce bias.

## Learning Reflections

Throughout this project, several key takeaways emerged:

- **Data Complexity:** Real-world health data often includes inconsistencies, reporting lags, and gapsâ€”requiring data cleaning and validation strategies.
- **Statistical Rigor:** Hypothesis testing and correlation analysis provided meaningful insights beyond surface-level trends.
- **Communication:** Presenting complex analyses to non-technical stakeholders required effective data storytelling using visual tools like Tableau.
- **Limitations Matter:** Recognizing and transparently reporting data limitations is essential for credibility and future work.
- **Adaptive Planning:** Real-time and granular data would enable more dynamic healthcare staffing models, an important lesson for future projects.

This project emphasized the importance of balancing technical analysis with human-centered outcomes.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Granular Data Access:** City-level and weekly data would support real-time resource adjustments.
2. **Dynamic Staffing Models:** Incorporate real-time flu incidence reports for flexible staff deployment.
3. **Monitoring & Evaluation:**
   - Track patient-to-staff ratios
   - ICU and hospitalization rates
   - Mortality rate trends among 65+ demographic

---

## Monitoring Metrics

- **Patient-to-Staff Ratios** (during peak flu season)
- **Staff Utilization Rates**
- **Post-Staffing Mortality Rates**
- **Regional ICU and hospitalization data**
- **Seasonal Cost-Benefit Analysis**
